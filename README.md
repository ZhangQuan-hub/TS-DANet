## 5. Settings
- Python 3.11 

- Pytorch 2.1.0

- CUDA 12.1

Note: Version inconsistency does not have a significant impact on performance.





## 6. Auxiliary code for Training and Acknowledgment
This repo is based on [SSRNET](https://github.com/hw2hwei/SSRNET), which is an exellent work. All training architectures are based on SSRNET. You should only change the **model.py** file to our proposed model.py.
